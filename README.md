# YouTube Clone

A YouTube clone application built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Redux**, and **Infinite Scroll**, simulating the YouTube homepage's video feed, sidebar, and navigation. This project pulls video data from YouTube's API (or a mock API) and displays it in a card layout with infinite scrolling, providing a seamless user experience for browsing videos.

## Features

- **Navbar**: Displays the applicationâ€™s header, including essential navigation such as the search bar, logo, and icons.
- **Sidebar**: A fixed sidebar with categories like **Home**, **Trending**, **Subscriptions**, etc., enhancing navigation (similar to YouTube's layout).
- **Video Feed**: Displays a grid of video cards with video titles, thumbnails, channel info, and video stats (views, age).
- **Infinite Scroll**: Automatically loads more videos as the user scrolls down the page, simulating YouTube's infinite scroll feature.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes for a smooth user experience, using Tailwind CSS.
- **Spinner**: A loading spinner appears when videos are being fetched or when more videos are being loaded.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Redux**: A state management library for React applications, used to manage global state.
- **Infinite Scroll**: A React component that implements infinite scrolling behavior.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, used to fetch data from the API.
- **TypeScript (optional)**: If you wish to add TypeScript for type safety (optional but recommended for large projects).
- **YouTube API**: Fetches video data from YouTube for the video feed, video details, and recommended videos.
